# CodeWars Challenges: [Visit Here](https://www.codewars.com/users/katic0des_). 
This repository is filled with code challenges (katas). I've currently completed 92 katas and push 3-5 katas per week!

**How It's Made:** 
- Javascript

Each day the first thing I aim to do is solve a codewar!


**Lessons Learned:** 
- Since starting to do CodeWars I've learned that there is still so much to learn and many different ways of implementing the same solution. Even if I'm unable to answer the challenge in full, that's alright. I still take the initiative to improve and understand the solution and what's happening so that I can come back to it and try again.
